# docker-AutoRecon

Runs https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon in a Kali based container.

The Dockerfile is adapted from the official Kali container at Gitlab https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-docker

The point of this is to run AutoRecon from a Fedora based VPS without dependency hassles.
